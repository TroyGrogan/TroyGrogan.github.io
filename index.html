                        Our users are not aware of the amount of possible fashionable outfits they already have in their own closet. This leads to people buying excessive amounts of clothes, rather than regularly rotating the clothes they already own. Our solution would implement a machine learning algorithm to put together outfits from already owned clothes for users. This allows our users to have more outfits without buying more clothes.

                        My group and I worked together to come up with a diagram explaining the environment that we want our app to contain. We want our users to be involved with the app's eocosytem while also solving the problem of people having too many clothes. We also want to help people style what they wear easier by having the user virtually try on clothes through augmented reality.
